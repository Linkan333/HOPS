# HOPS Project
This project started in 2024-04-09
By 2 common Windows users
Windows 10-11
This is beginning of an journey to get hired at Microsoft and job in silicon Valley by Linkan and MikeDizzy
We are going to extend and update this document and write exactly what we have acclompished during this journey and hopefully get a few followers on the way and likes on this projekt :)


# Research - Step 1
Gather information how the Windows system works deep down how we can exploit regedit and gpedit.msc


# Fuzzing - Step 2
We will fuzz through the windows system in various methods and explain how we do it and what we found on the way and if we find bugs we are going to get to # step 3

# How does the bug act? - Step 3
We will research how this bug is acting and also see if we can find any similar bugs on exploit-db.com or CVEBASE
if we find we are going to look closer on the code of it and see if we can create a similar exploit and code to this new bug 

# Exploiting the bug - Step 4
We are going to create code as mentioned above to see what we will end up with and how we can abuse this bug to benefit us and what people should be alerted to

# How is the bug acting with the exploit code - Step 5
We are going to go deeper into the bug and the system with researching how the bug acts when it is exploited and see if we can go further down this road to benefit us even more and see if the bug is a known one or a "0-day"

# Alerting Microsoft about the bug and explaining what we have accomplished - Step 6

# Updates:
2024-04-09 We are going to start the Research today and continue to 2024-04-25
2024-04-25 We are going to start the Fuzzing and searching for the bugs until 2024-05-21
2024-05-21 We are going to start the bug act and see how it will act until 2024-06-18
2024-06-18 We are going to start exploiting the bug and see how it works and find other similar until 2024-07-16
2024-07-16 We are going to start documenting how the bug acts with the exploited code and if acts similar as before until 2024-08-20
2024-08-20 We are going to start documenting and alerting Microsoft how the project goes and what will happen and see if we can help fix it and maybe get hired by Microsoft. :)
