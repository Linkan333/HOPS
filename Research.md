! I will continuesly update this txt file with accomplishment same as the readme file but this will go a little deeper on what i have learned that specific day and summary and conclusions !

Well because finding bugs is kind of new to me unless you see it like i got into my schools router system Windows bugs is completely new for me so i started watching a youtube whos name is Low Level Learning wich is exactly what i need to start finding bugs in Windows.
I am going to start with going through different softwares / windows components and scanning with libfuzzer for bugs and see if Windows has any opensource files otherwise i will decompile and reverse engineer it my self
To start with our journey i will make 2 files in a folder called "Research/Software Bugs"
